![alt txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b216559-61d7-4f75-99d1-be5d9df5c233)

This repository contains code for the analysis of C9orf72 haploinsufficiency and knockout in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Thesis link to be added, as well as fastq link.

## Folder Structure 
There are two main folders: C9Mouse_Frontal_Cortex and hippocampus_multiome_2024 containing analyses of the frontal cortex and hippocampus respectively. Within each, there is a main.R file which sources all functions used from the R folder to run analyses. Other folders correspond to outputs and objects/figures created.
In the parent folder, there are two jupyter notebooks: ccans.ipnyb and figure_plot.ipnyb which contain code to generate ccans and figures used in the thesis respectively.
